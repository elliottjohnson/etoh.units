oeno.units: common and uncommon units used in beverage production.

Building upon unit-formulas, this library provides many standard,
metric, historical, and exotic units used in beverage production.

Most of the units were from the pedagogy of professors of Fresno
State's Enology program (R.I.P. Ken Fugelsang) and found online.

Online resources include wikipedia.org, ttb.gov, conversioncenter.net,
and winebusiness.com.  Information was cross referenced between
resources to ensure a general consensus on unit magnitudes.

No claims are made as the accuracy of these unit definitions.  Any
miscalculations attributed to the use of these softwares is solely the
risk of the software user and this project in no way guarantees the
validity or correctness of any unit conversions performed by it.

That being said, any improvements, additions, or error reports are
welcome in an attempt to better represent units used in beverage
production.

Cheers!
